# Console3D

This is an attempt to display 3D graphics into command prompt console.

This project has been set up under Visual Studio Community 2017.

Be sure to set the "Console3D" project as the default project.

I recommend to use these parameters for the console window in order to have a correct display of the 3D scenes
(those parameters can be found by clicking the top left icon of the window, and under "Properties")
  - Window size :
    > Width  = 180
    > Height = 120
  - Font :
    > Polices Raster
    > Size = 8x8
    
Controls (ATTENTION : hard coded)
  - Z = go forward
  - Q = strafe left
  - S = go backward
  - D = strafe right
  - Mouse movement = camera control
  - P = pauses / resumes the simulation. It releases the mouse cursor so one can interact with Windows.
  - ESC = end the simulation
