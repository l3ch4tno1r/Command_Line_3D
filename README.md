# Console3D [![GitHub release (latest by date)](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/l3ch4tno1r/Command_Line_3D)](https://github.com/l3ch4tno1r/Command_Line_3D/releases)

This is a little amateur project of a 3D Graphic Engine made from scratch using only the command prompt console. No hardware acceleration, no OpenGL... Just the CPU doing its best.

You can find some demonstrations on the [LCN Tech Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9vdiZ7gYO0) :

## Cloning

You can clone this project using the following command :

`git clone --recursive https://github.com/l3ch4tno1r/Command_Line_3D.git`

`/!\ Warning /!\` : Be sure to do a `--recursive` clone in order to clone all the submodules

## Getting started

This project has been set up under Visual Studio Community 2017.

Be sure to set the "Console3D" project as the default project.

## Controls
    
Default controls for AZERTY keyboard (it is possible to change this configuration by editing the config.txt file) :
  - Z = go forward
  - Q = strafe left
  - S = go backward
  - D = strafe right
  - Mouse movement = camera control
  - P = pauses / resumes the simulation. It releases the mouse cursor so one can interact with Windows.
  - ESC = end the simulation
